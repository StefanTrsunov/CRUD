Making a CRUD web application(authentication)

CRUD is a shourcut for:
C - CREATE
R - READ
U - UPDATE
D - DELETE

I'm using Python/Flask for this project so if you want to start this project in your machine make sure you have Flask installed


Starting the project for the first time:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ virtualenv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ flask run

If you have a virtual enviorment and installed the libraries:
$ flask run
